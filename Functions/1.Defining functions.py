# this is an example with math for you to undertand, lets say we have the function in math: f(x)=x**2, in python it's like this
def f(x):
    return x**2

print(f(5))

# the f is the name of our functin, and the (x) is the parameter (in math it was our x-coordinate input)
# and the thing that we right after return is the like the answer to the function like y=x**2 or same as f(x)=x**2
