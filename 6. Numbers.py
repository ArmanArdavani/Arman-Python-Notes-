# Arithmetic operations in python 
print(10 + 6)
print(10 - 3)
print(10 * 3)
print(10 / 3)
print(10 // 3) # it gives the interger answer of the division (whole number wihout the decimals) 
print(10 % 3)  # this gives the remainder of a division
print(10 **3)  # for exponents (10 to the power of 3)


x = 10 
x = x + 3 # this two lines give the same answer 
x += 3    # this is an augmented assihnment operator
